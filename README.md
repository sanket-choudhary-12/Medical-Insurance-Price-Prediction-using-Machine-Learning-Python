Medical Insurance Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the medical insurance prices using various machine learning algorithms. The steps involved include performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model fitting with multiple regression algorithms.

Project Steps
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, if any.
Data Visualization: Used visual tools to understand the distribution and relationships in the data.
Feature Engineering: Created new features to enhance model performance.
Model Training

Implemented and trained the model on the following algorithms:

Linear Regression
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Model Evaluation

Evaluated each model using metrics such as RÂ² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Compared the performance of all models and selected the best one based on the evaluation metrics.
Best Model
After evaluating all models, XGBoost Regressor was chosen as the best model for predicting medical insurance prices due to its superior performance in terms of accuracy and generalization.

Usage
